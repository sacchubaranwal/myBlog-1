         <h1 class="highlight">In 2005, Steve Jobs gave a legendary commencement speech at Stanford University. He echoed over and over, "Love what you do." But...</h1>

         <p>The now-famous statement has morphed into its syrupy cousin , "Do what you love." And every time I hear it, I lose another millimeter of my molars.</p>

            <p class="highlight">But wait, there’s more.</p>

         <p>“Do what you love” also has a twin: the pithy proverb “Follow your passion.”
            Again, another perilous dose of direction, usually dispensed by unknown
            bloggers with unknown track records who unknowingly don’t know the theology
            is hogwash.</p>

         <p class="highlight">Put ’em together and what you get is The Wonder Twins of Epically Bad Life
            Advice.</p>

            <p>This cattle call of the self-development world has spawned a worshiping
                army of “passionites,” where “do what you love” and “follow your passion” supplant demand, business models, and economics.</p>

            <p>Everyone is passionate about one thing or another. The problem is no one
                interviews passionate failures. Failed passionites have no stage, no audience, no
                one salivating at their greatness. The bankrupt passionite who’s followed his
                passion for twenty years and didn't get featured in Inc. Magazine isn’t dispensing
                advice.</p>

                <p class="highlight">Think of it this way.</p>

         <br>

         <h1>No one cares what you love</h1>

         <img class="hero-img" src="noOne.jpg" />

         <p>Are American Idol winners passionate about singing? Of course they are.
            Does it make sense to sing auditions when you’re dispassionate about it?
            Therefore, the 190,000 people who also auditioned and went home crying
            failures were also passionate. Will you ever hear from them? Nope.</p>

         <p>Let me put it another way. You’re at a fancy restaurant and order steak,
            medium rare. The steak hits your table and it tastes like grilled leather and isn’t
            fit for a vulture. You complain to the server and refuse to pay. The server
            retrieves the owner, who’s also the chef. When the owner/chef arrives at your
            table, you explain that your meal tastes like baked cardboard and refuse payment.
            He replies, “I’m sorry, sir, but I love to cook. And since I love cooking, you must
            also love what I do.”</p>

         <p>You see, at the end of the day, no one cares about the motives driving you.
            No one gives a shit that you love what you do! No one cares that you want to “be
            your own boss,” “get rich,” or any other selfishly conceived motive.</p>

            <small>Once again, the point needs to be driven home: no one fucking cares.</small>

         <p>Your parents said you were special. Maybe, but in the eyes of the market, it’s
            a fantastic lie. The market is one selfish rat, and if you insist on being selfish
            yourself, you don’t have a prayer. When passion doesn’t solve people’s problems,
            passion doesn’t pay bills.</p>

         <br>

         <h1> Some real-life examples</h1>

         <img class="hero-img" src="fool.jpg" />

         <p>Does a market even exist for what you love? Do other people need what you
            love, and if so, are you exceptional at it while communicating a unique value
            proposition? If you aren’t, be prepared to prostitute your love in the name of
            paying bills.</p>

         <p>1. Markets flooded with “do what you lovers” are extremely crowded and ripyour-
            hair-out competitive. Does the Internet really need 190,000 weight-loss blogs? Yes, I get it—you lost weight; you’re passionate about the
            accomplishment; now you want to spread the gospel. But so are 400,000 other
            people, and unless you’re doing something different, you remain unremarkable. </p>

            <p class="highlight">Passion didn’t pay the bills because passion didn’t hit a market need.</p>

         <p>“Should I start a fitness blog?” “Do I start
            a car social network?” NOTE:<span class="highlight">Always keep this in mind--</span> , “What value are you offering” or
            “What are you doing different that hasn’t been beaten to death elsewhere?” the
            answer is always the same: nothing. For the lost, “do what you love” and “follow
            your passion” are suddenly a business model impervious to market economics.</p>

         <p>2. Take for example personal training—a career rife with “do what you love”
            and “follow your passion” go-getters. The fitness person thinks, “Hey, I love
            fitness, so I’ll be a personal trainer!” Great, except you are an ant on an anthill.
            Thousands more think identically, and as a result, the aggregate trainer pool
            could fill fifty coliseums. Thousands are eager to undercut your livable wage.
            And once that happens, guess what? Your love withers into hate.</p>

         <br>

         <h1> Effect of opportunoty compression</h1>
 
         <img class="hero-img" src="blind.png" />

         <p>Another injurious effect stemming from the dynamic duo of bad advice is
            opportunity compression. Opportunity compression limits your exposure to new
            opportunities in alternative industries that are ripe for new value offerings.</p>

         <p>For example, if you’re passionate only about sewing and scuba diving, you will
            compress your available opportunities to those industries only. If those
            industries represent only .00002 percent of GDP, you limit yourself to that small
            pool of opportunity. Don’t microscope yourself into a puddle when you should
            be surveying the ocean. </p>

         <br>

         <h1>The overjustification effect--</h1>

         <img class="hero-img" src="justification.jpg" />

         <p>The fourth reason why “love” and “passion” shouldn’t be your bread-maker
            is called the overjustification effect. The overjustification effect is a
            psychologically studied phenomenon lending credibility to the idea that “do
            what you love” and “follow your passion” are destructive career advice. Namely,
            once you get paid extrinsic rewards for something you once did freely due to
            sheer intrinsic motives, your interest in that activity suffers. According to
            Wikipedia via Psychology: The Science of Behavior, the overjustification effect
            occurs…</p>

         <img class="hero-img" src="ove.png" />

         <p>So, if you’re doing something freely because you’re passionate about it,
            suddenly getting paid for it might poison that passion.</p>

         <p>“Do what you love” can kill your love.</p>

         <p class="highlight"> Here's an example~~</p>

         <small>I have taken this example from the fastlane forum ,runned by MJ-DeMarco</small>

         <img class="hero-img" src="overJ.png" />

         <h1 class="highlight">The Final Reason</h1>

         <p>The final reason why “do what you love” and “follow your passion” are
            crummy advice is perhaps the most potent and destructive: they’re Trojan horses into a fixed mindset, a justification to avoid pain and discomfort, and hence,
            inhibit growth. Let me explain...</p>

         <p>And this highlights the ultimate irony: the secret to success isn’t “do what you
            love” but “do what you hate.” How much pain and anxiety you’ll endure tells me
            how much success you’re willing to achieve. You see, passion doesn’t move me to
            do programming or build apps. And passion certainly doesn’t put me in
            sweat when I program for straight 6 hours <span class="highlight" —meaning-and-purpose gets me there.></span></p>

            <p>In the end, the wonder twins maliciously give you good cause to decline
                anything that looks like work, seems discomforting, and isn’t aligned with
                passion.</p>

                <hr>
             
                <p>Simply put, <span class="highlight" you’ll never grow into the person you need to become because
                    you’re too busy avoiding transformative pain. ></span> And in the world of passionites, it’s
                    perfectly justifiable because, after all, Steve Jobs says, “Love what you do.”</p>

                <hr>

                <h1 class="highlight">CONCLUSION</h1>

                <p class="highlight">So… was Steve Jobs’s advice, “Love what you do,” wrong? Should we ignore
                    the billionaire’s advice..?  what I can say is, he wasn’t giving us the golden key
                    unlocking the secret into pain-free success. He instead gave us insight into the
                    joy and love one receives when the world values your value. Notably, when the
                    world kicks on your feedback loop and says “This is awesome” or “I like this;
                    here’s my cash,” you too will love what you do. Let’s look back at the motivation
                    cycle and create something more valuable and that is how you fall in love with what you do.</p>
